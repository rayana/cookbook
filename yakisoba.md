# Yakisoba
A favorite Japanese noodle stir-fry dish, Yakisoba is a classic izakaya (pub/tapas style) food that goes great with beer.
I loved ordering home delivery with my mom on weekends and our # 1 choice were the thick, saucy noodles. This recipe is adapted from a Japanese home-style cooking class I took in Amsterdam in March 2018.

* Serves: 4-5
* Preparation time: 30 min
* Cooking time: 10 min

## Ingredients
- 4 packs of Japanese style ramen noodles - 180g/pack (you can also use Udon noodles)
- 300g of steak
- 300g of chicken breast
- 150g of carrots
- 100g of bean sprouts
- 100g of mushrooms
- 1/2 cabbage head
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1 medium onion
- 2 tablespoons of sake
- 2 tablespoons of oil
- 100ml of Worcester sauce
- Ao-nori (dried seaweed)
- Dried bonito flakes
- Salt & pepper

## Directions
- Dip the noodles in warm water to unstick them. Rinse. Add 2 tablespoons of sake. Reserve.
- Cut the carrots, bean sprouts, cabbage, bell pepper and onion in thin stripes. The trick is to have the vegetable cut in consistent stripes so the ingredients mix harmoniously with the noodles.
- Cut the mushrooms into slices. Reserve.
- Cut the steak and chicken breast into stripes of similar sizes. Season it with salt and pepper. Reserve.
- Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok pan, add all the noodles and cook it over medium heat until the bottom of the noodles is golden brown (3-4 min). Turn over and brown the other side. Do not mix or touch the noodles in the process. Reserve.
- Add the steak and chicken breast and quickly brown on each side. Add the carrots, cabbage, bell pepper and onion to the meat in the pan. Fry over medium heat for 4 minutes, then add the bean sprouts and mushrooms.
- Add the noodles to the mix and stir gently over a high heat for another 1 minute. Add the Worcester sauce.
- Place the mix on a plate and top it with ao-nori and pretty flakes. Serve it with Worcester sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.
