# Oven-roasted Picanha with Cassava puree
I bet 99.99% of people think about barbecue (or Churrasco) when asked to name a Brazilian food. I would too. Picanha (called sirloin cap in the U.S.A and Staartstuk in the Netherlands) is the most prized cut of meat in Brazil. A timeless classic, the ideal way to cooking Picanha is over an open-flame grill with natural wood charcoal. As an alternative to the non-barbecue/grill life, I prepare my Picanha in the oven. 

To say grace to my northeastern roots, I love serving Picanha with Cassava as a way to transport my guests to a true Brazilian table. Popular in South-America, Cassava (or macaxeira, mandioca in Portuguese) is a long, woody shrub that can be cooked, deep-fried or served as a puree.

The mix results in a unique roast, with rich flavor from meat cooked on sea-salt, and superb cassava puree on the side.

* Serves: 4
* Preparation: 40 min
* Cooking: 45 min

## Ingredients
### For the Picanha
- 1 cut of Picanha (1,2 kg)
- 3 big onions
- Minced garlic
- Rock salt
- Black pepper
- Oil

### For the Cassava puree
- 1 cassava (800g)
- Coriander
- 50ml of milk or heavy cream
- 80g of butter
- Salt and pepper

## Directions
## Picanha
- Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/356Â°F
- Cut the onions in quarters. Reserve.
- Pat the Picanha with a paper towel to remove any moisture. Season with garlic, salt & pepper generously on all sides of the beef - you should see the salt crystals on the meat. Don't be afraid, that's the secret ðŸ˜‹
- Brush a large roasting pan with oil and Place the Picanha fat side up in it. Place the onions next to it and cover the pan with aluminum foil.
- Roast it for about 45 min for a medium-rare roast.
- Carve the Picanha and serve hot with the gravy and cassava puree.

## Cassava puree
- Wash the cassava and peel it under running water. Cut in thick rings cook it in gently boiling water until tender (15-20 min), then drain and press it with a fork into the pan.
- Return the pan to a medium heat and using a wooden spoon, stir the cassava for 1-2 min to dry them out. Add the butter, coriander, milk/heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve hot next to the Picanha.
