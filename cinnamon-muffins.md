# Cinnamon Muffins

I was craving cake but didn't want to go through the hassle of baking a big piece and cutting everything into pieces to later eat it with a big cup of tea. Instead, I decided I would finally bake something from [Technicolor Kitchen](http://technicolorkitchen.blogspot.com/2010/09/muffins-de-canela-com-farofinha-de.html), a blog I have a long relationship with as a ghost reader. Patricia from TK is an incredible baker, and an inspiration to future baker-me.
As baking cakes is always an issue to me -- not the process per se but the fact I tend to eat the whole thing myself --, muffins seemed to be a good idea. I changed a few things here and there to make it less sweet (blame it on my Dutch boyfriend) and a bit healthier, swapping withe flour with the more flaverful almond version. The result was a batch of soft and perfumed muffins, that I shared with friends after dinner.

- Serves 17 muffins
- Preparation: 10 min
- Baking: 20 min

## Ingredients
### For the crumbs
- ½ cup of wheat flour (70g)
- ½ cup of sugar (100g)
- 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
- 5 spoons of unsalted butter, cold, cut into cubes (70g)

### For the muffins
- 1 cup of wheat flour (140g)
- 1 cup of almond flour (140g)
- ½ cup of sugar (100g)
- 1 table spoon of baking powder
- 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon of salt
- ½ cup of unsalted butter, melted, room temperature (113g)
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ cup milk (180ml) 
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions
- Preheat the oven to 180°C/356°F. Grease and flour a cupcakes/muffin baking sheet. I used a silicone one.
- Start off by making the crumbles. Mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add the butter and use your fingertips to rub it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Set aside in the refrigerator.
- Muffins: in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
- In another bowl, whisk the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract together until well combined. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and, with a fork, gently but quickly stir to blend. Don't worry about being thorough--the batter will be lumpy, and that is just the way it should be. 
- Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Sprinkle some of the crumbs over each muffin, then use your fingertips to gently press the crumbs into the batter. 
- Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean.
- Transfer the pan to a rack and let it cool for 5 minutes before carefully removing each muffin from its mold.
