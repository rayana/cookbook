# Roll Cake

A traditional dessert from Pernambuco state, Brazil, [Roller Cake] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_de_rolo) is a sugary cake rolled in layers of fine, sweet pastry and [Goiabada] (https: // en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goiabada) (guava jam). Oh, my! ðŸ˜‹âœ¨ As a Pernambucana, I grew up eating slices of this cake after lunch or an afternoon snack, paired with coffee, ice cream, or cheese to create a combination we call "Romeo and Juliet". We love this cake so much that an Ordinary Law recognized the Roll Cake as intangible heritage of Pernambuco ðŸ’•.

I always thought this to be a very complicated and time-consuming recipe to make since I never heard of anyone preparing homemade roll cake - we often buy it from a bakery or get it as a dessert in a restaurant. Living abroad I change my perspective on cooking and more I want to be able to cook my favorite dishes. Luckily, I found an incredible video tutorial on [Youtube] (https://youtu.be/vbAjhGzXakM) (in Portuguese) explaining in detail how to bake this dessert form the comfort of my Dutch kitchen - with an essential ingredient, Goiabada guava paste). My life was never the same ever since.

## Before you start
- It's essential to have a baking tray of max. 1cm deep. You will need to spread the cake batter as thin as possible on the tray.
- Goiabada (guava paste) is a popular Brazilian dessert. Though not very common in Europe, you can substitute it with any jam of your choice. Just make sure your conserve's consistency is a thin paste and not liquid. If you're feeling adventurous, use Nutella or peanut butter as replacements!

## Ingredients
### For the cake batter
200g of sugar
- 200g of margarine or butter (unsalted)
- 200g of sifted wheat flour
- 4 eggs (yolk and whites separated)

### For the filling
- 300g of guava jam

## Directions
- With an electric beater in high speed, mix the margarine/butter with the sugar to obtain a smooth paste. Add the 4 egg yolks until smooth.
- With a spoon add the sifted wheat flour in portions, with the beater on low speed.
- In a new bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff, then with a spoon fold into the cake batter, one third at a time. The result should be a firm, smooth batter.

### Assembling
- Grease and flour the bread before adding the batter.
- Spread the batter in a very thin layer using a spatula. You should make the thickness of the layer as even as possible. This will allow the jam to be layered between thin layers of batter when the cake is rolled.
- Bake it for 2-3 minutes. Watch it carefully because the cake is very thin and it can burn easily. When touching the baked cake with the tip of your finger, the batter should not stick.
- Remove from the oven and spread the guava jam over the entire surface.
- Gently run a butter knife around the edges to loosen the cake from pan, making it easier to unmold. Grab the edges from one end and start to roll the cake like a piece of paper - it's so fun! ðŸ˜ƒ Move slowly and do not worry if the cake cracks a bit. Once you've rolled the whole cake, but reserve it and repeat the assembling process with the rest of the batter.
- The new baked tray should be rolled around the already rolled cake and so on ...
- Slice the edges of the cake to remove imperfect ends.
- Sprinkle sugar on it and serve the cake into thin slices with vanilla ice cream.
